## Dynamic risk prediction triggered by intermediate events using survival tree ensembles

This repository contains example codes used to run the simulation in the
manuscript “Dynamic risk prediction triggered by intermediate events
using survival tree ensembles” described in
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07175>.

## Example

Depending on the landarmk time and how the longitudinal predictors are
measured, we provide the following examples in this repository.

  - [Landmark time is the intermediate event and longitudinal predictors
    are measured at the intermediate
    event](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/stc04003/DynmaicRisk/blob/main/Examples/sim3C.html).
