## Dynamic risk prediction triggered by intermediate events using survival tree ensembles

This repository contains example codes used to run the simulation in the
manuscript “Dynamic risk prediction triggered by intermediate events
using survival tree ensembles” described in
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07175>.

## Example

Depending on the landarmk time and how the longitudinal predictors are
measured, we provide the following examples in this repository.

  - [Random landmark time with longitudinal predictors measured at
    \(t_1, t_2, \ldots\)](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/stc04003/DynmaicRisk/blob/main/Examples/sim3A.html).
  - [Fixed landmark time with longitudinal predictors measured at the
    intermediate
    event](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/stc04003/DynmaicRisk/blob/main/Examples/sim3B.html).
  - [Random landmark time with longitudinal predictors measured at the
    intermediate
    event](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/stc04003/DynmaicRisk/blob/main/Examples/sim3C.html).
