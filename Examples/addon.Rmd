This vignette explains the functions in `../codes/ranger-addon.R`, 
which contains `R` functions that applies the proposed ensemble procedure to `ranger` objects 
created by the `ranger()` function from the `ranger` package (Wright and Ziegler, 2017).
These functions can be loaded with `source()`.
```{R}
source("../codes/ranger-addon.R")
```

### Predicted survival using ensemble method

Given a partition created by `ranger()`, 
the proposed ensemble procedure is used to obtain survival estimate. 
The procedure is implemented in the `getSurv()` function.
```{R}
args(getSurv)
```
The `getSurv()` function takes the following three arguments. 

  - `fit` is a `ranger` object created by the `ranger()` function from the `ranger` package. 
  - `trainDat` is a data frame indicating the training data used to construct the `ranger` object in `fit`.
  - `testDat` is a data frame indicating the testing data, which we want to obtain the predicted survival function for.
  
The `getSurv()` function returns a list, where the $i$th member of the list 
is the estimated survival function for the $i$th subject from `testDat`.

### Concordance measure

The concordance measure is equivalent to the area under the ROC curve and is useful for
evaluating model performances. 
The specified form of the concordance measure is provided in Sun et al. (2022). 
In here, we considered two versions of the concordance measures; 
`getCON()` implements the concordance measure definded in Equation 6 in Sun et al. (2022)
and `getCON2()` implements a weighted concordance measure that assigns equal weights 
to all time points described at the end of Section 4 in Sun et al. (2022).
The weighted concordance measure has the potential to avoid unstable estimation for very small or large time points and is
used in variable importance.

These concordance functions take on four arguments. 

```{R}
args(getCON)
args(getCON2)
```

The four arguments are described below.

  - `tt` is a numerical value indicate the time point the concordance measure is evaluated.
  - `si` is a list of predicted survival function prepared by the `getSurv()` function.
  - `sc` is a function that presents an estimate of the censoring time survival function. 
  - `dat` is a data frame containing the time and the censoring indicator used to calculate the concordance measure.   

## Out-of-bag survival 

Variable importance is a useful measure for understanding the impact of predictors in tree ensembles and can be used as a reference for variable selection. 
In the original random forests, each tree is constructed using a bootstrap sample of the original data, and the out-of-bag (OOB) data can be used to estimate the OOB prediction performance. 
The OOB survival can be obtained by the `getSi()` function. 

```{R}
args(getSi)
```

The two arguments are as follow.

  - `fit` is a `ranger` object created by the `ranger()` function from the `ranger` package. 
  - `dat` is a data frame used to compute the OOB survival.


The `getSi()` function returns a list, where the $i$th member of the list gives the estimated survival
when the $i$th subject is left out.
